              Hi! I am a Jr. Software Engineer with an incredibe passion for web development. I took advantage of all the time
              spent at home during the 2020 pandemic to further my software
              engineering skills. I attended an immersive remote bootcamp at General Assembly and I learned
              so many new modern languages, frameworks and best practices. I am currently working on a few exciting projects to keep putting my skills to the test and I am also looking for a team I can invest myself in.
