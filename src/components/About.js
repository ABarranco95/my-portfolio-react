              Hi! I am a Jr. Software Engineer with an incredibe passion of
              passion for web development. I took advantage of all the time
              spent at home during the 2020 pandemic to study software
              engineering. I attended an immersive remote bootcamp and I learn
              so many languages, frameworks and tools. The most important thing
              I have learned however, is the ability to keep learning. ABC
